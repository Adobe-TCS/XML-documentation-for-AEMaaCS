# **XML DOCUMENTATION FOR AEM**

## Overview:

**XML Documentation for Adobe Experience Manager** adds native DITA support to AEM. With this integration, it provides an end-to-end, enterprise-class, component content management system (CCMS) for DITA-based content creation and delivery. It provides all the core capabilities of a CCMS like version management, web-based collaboration, review &amp; approval, translation, search and reporting. It also provides a single-click publishing capability for DITA content to a mobile responsive web format, in addition to popular formats like PDF, EPUB, etc.

**NOTE:** This repo is only for new AEM cloud users. It contains the complete maven archetype AEM project with integrated XML documentation solution to get started.You should just replace the code generated by the cloud manager with this code to avoid any manual integration of XML documentation solution

Existing AEM cloud users need to use the below **DoX Installer for AEMaaCS** repository to integrate the XML Documentation solution in their code.
